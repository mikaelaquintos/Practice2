# Problem 1
#
# Create a player file that can be used to inject a daily heating setpoint schedule.  
# Nighttime (72degF) is 9PM to 6AM and daytime (75degF) is 6AM to 9PM.
# (Hint: use relative times.)
#
# Solution
#
# It is important to realize that schedules "wrap around" so that the 9 hour period
# from 9pm to 6am must be divided into a 3 hour period from 9am to midnight and 6
# hour period from midnight to 6am
